Welcome in the Neuroc repository! Neuroc is a modular library based on the idea of smart blocks that permits to create different kind of artificial neural networks. The heart of the library is the neuron class, an object made of different functions. The modular approach allow the user to highly customize the networks. The architecture is inspired by the {\itshape Matlab Neural Networks Toolbox}, if you are interested you can find other details about neuroc design \hyperlink{md__a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e}{here}. Let's look now at the main features of Neuroc\-:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Modular and expandible
\item Safe memory management
\item Object Oriented approach
\item Zero external dependences (self-\/contained library)
\item All you can eat network architectures
\item Customizable Transfer Function, Weight Initialization
\item Open source (G\-N\-U v.\-2 license)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Neuroc uses the class std\-::function introduced in C++11 to build high customizable networks. In fact many types of artificial neural networks can be decomposed and assembled starting from the same elementary blocks.

\subsection*{Prerequisites }

To install the library you must have \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}g++\char`\"{} already installed on your system. You can install them from a Unix system running the following commands from the terminal\-:

{\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install g++ build-\/essential}

\subsection*{Installation }

If you are using a Unix system you can install the library very easily\-:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repository or download it from \href{https://github.com/mpatacchiola/neuroc/archive/master.zip}{\tt here}
\item Extract the files from the archive and save them in a folder on your computer
\item Open the terminal inside that folder and type the following command
\item {\ttfamily make compile}
\item If everything is right you will find the shared and static libraries (libneuroc.\-so, libneuroc.\-a) inside the folder {\itshape bin/lib}. You have to install the library typing the following command
\item {\ttfamily sudo make install}
\item The installation is complete, the library files were copied inside the system folders and they are ready to be used
\item To remove the library you have to write {\ttfamily sudo make clean} in the terminal, it will delete all the files produced during the installation
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\subsection*{Using the library in your own code }

After the installation neuroc was copied on your system, inside the folder $\ast$/usr/local/lib$\ast$ you can see the shared library libneuroc.\-so and the static library libneuroc.\-a. The header files were copied in $\ast$/usr/local/include$\ast$, you need them in order to use the library. To use the shared library it is also necessary to link it to your project. In g++ this is very easy, here is an example\-:

{\ttfamily g++ -\/std=c++11 -\/f\-P\-I\-C -\/\-I/usr/local/include/neuroc -\/\-L/usr/local/lib -\/\-Wl,-\/-\/no-\/as-\/needed mycode.\-cpp -\/o mycode -\/lneuroc}

This command will compile the imaginary file mycode.\-cpp and will produce an executable file called mycode in your project directory. To check if the shared library is linked to your executable, you can run the Unix command ldd. Using g++ it is also possible to use the static version of the library\-:

{\ttfamily g++ -\/std=c++11 -\/\-I/usr/local/include/neuroc -\/\-L/usr/local/lib -\/static mycode.\-cpp -\/o mycode -\/lneuroc}

In this case the library will be statically included inside your code. To integrate neuroc in a different environment (ex Eclipse, Code\-::\-Blocks, etc) follow the istructions given by the producer on how to integrate an external shared library or a static one.

\subsection*{Examples }

Neuroc permits to create different kind of network. Every object is a container where you can push other objects or data. The class network is a container of Layers, the class Layers is a container of Neurons and the class Dataset is a container of input/target values. Some examples are present in the folder {\itshape neuroc/examples}.

\subsection*{Documentation }

The documentation is produced with Doxygen and the H\-T\-M\-L output can be found inside the folder {\itshape neuroc/doc/html}. An explenation of the logic behind the architecture can be found in this specific \hyperlink{md__a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e}{readme}.
